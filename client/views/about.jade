                p Hello word enthusiast. Ramblings is a real-time literary experiment/game that enables users to collaboratively assemble a story, one word at a time.<br><br>This experiment was built with Node (JavaScript), a handful of sockets, an attention-seeking cat*, and a bottle of sake.
                p To contribute, click <span>Play</span> and choose a pen name. Follow the queue as indicated in the top left.  The number of words remaining is in the top right.  A sound will alert you when it is your turn, in case you doze off in anticipation.
                p You will have 25 seconds to enter a single word.  The <span>Contribute</span> button will change colors when you have satisifed the requirements (no spaces and not blank).  If you choose to end the word with a period, exclamation, question mark, or quotation, a new paragraph button - <span>&para;</span> - will appear.  Pressing it instead of <span>Contribute</span> will both submit your word AND start the next user on a fresh paragraph.
                p Ramblings is more fun to play with other people:
